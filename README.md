# CSDiary
by Mariana Sierra


There is a lot of information a CS student needs to survive. Like... a lot!
And all the note taking techniques are not enough, I end up going back to my notes and
not understanding anything (sorry Mariana from the past) or looking for the exact same questions in
Google and Stackoverflow, don't get me wrong, the purple link is really helpful but it is very frustraiting when you know that you have
looked for that exact same question in the past and you know you should have write the answer somewhere else.
Bookmarks, pocket.io, OneNote, physical notebooks, nope. Not enough. 

So here it is, my last, desperate
way to capture what is important! Accesible just an Internet connection, my phone
or my computer.

Hope it helps, and maybe one day, it helps you.
