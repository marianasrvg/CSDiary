    <p>There is a lot of information a CS student needs to survive. Like... a lot!
        And all the note taking techniques are not enought, I end up going back to my notes and
        not understanding anything (sorry Mariana from the past) or looking for the exact same questions in
        Google and Stackoverflow, that are really helpful but very frustraiting when you know that you have
        looked for that exact same question in the past and you know you should write the answer somewhere else.
        Bookmarks, pocket.io, OneNote, physical notebooks, nope. Not enought. So here it is, my last, desperate
        way to capture what is important, accesible with out any type of account, just an internet connection, my phone
        or my computer.
    </p>
    <p>Hope it helps, and helps you.</p>
