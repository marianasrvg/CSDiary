# LOG
Just a log of _thoughts_ about this project...

> Maybe I'll start practicing my tech writing

11/19 - What do you think will happen if I start writing every basic thing I learn at my classes, job, projects, etc. for the next, let's say, 2 months?

07/19 - Didn't do it, but I'll start with basic `markdown` because I get caught up in the `HTML`.
